# scalr_role Data Source

This data source is used to retrieve details of a single role by name and account_id.

## Example Usage

To retrieve a custom role, an account id and the role name is required, for example: 

```hcl
data "scalr_role" "example" {
  name           = "WorkspaceAdmin"
  account_id     = "acc-xxxxxxxxx"
}
```

To retrieve system-managed roles an account id has to be omitted, for example:

```hcl
data "scalr_role" "example" {
  name           = "user"
}
```
